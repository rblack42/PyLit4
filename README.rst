This application is a Python Flask project designed to provide a web tool for
creating `Literate Programming` based projects. In this system, the
project code is contained in a set of `reStructuredText` files and
extracted from those files each time the code is tested. The application is
designed to be hosted on a service like Github_ or one using GitLab_

PyLit4_ is also a general purpose tool I use to host lecture notes for classes I teach at |ACC|.
